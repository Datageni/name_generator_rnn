# Name Generator Recurrent Neural Network

In this tutorial, we will explore how to generate names using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture in PyTorch. The goal is to train an RNN to generate plausible names based on a given dataset of existing names from different languages. RNNs are particularly well-suited for this task because they are designed to handle sequential data, making them ideal for text generation.

Generating text with neural networks is a significant skill in the realm of natural language processing (NLP). Text generation has numerous applications, including automated content creation, chatbots, and language translation.
